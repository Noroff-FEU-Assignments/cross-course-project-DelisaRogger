    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security
        attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
    <ol>
        <li>Secure authorization and authentication. This is achieved by using an authorization protocol like
            OneLogin. This way the authentication and authorization will be hard to hack. </li>
        <li>Sanitize data before displaying it. Web applications cannot trust data from a web browser. By sanitizing
            data, you ensure that the system will get the right format. This sanitization can be done manually or by a
            third party. </li>
        <li>Use HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts data sent between a client and a server. Attackers will have difficulty
            collecting information about login, cookies, and various data. </li>
        <li>Vulnerability scanning tools. There are several tools that will scan a site and inform if there are
            potential security threats.</li>
        <li>Automatic user timeout. By automatic timeout a users references will not rest in the browser when the user
            was inactive for a certain amount of time. </li>
    </ol>
